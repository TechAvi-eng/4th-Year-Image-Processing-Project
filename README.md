# Multires ML Microscopy

This is the GitHub repo for the project Advancing Medical Image Analysis through Machine Learning Techniques by Nikhil Dhulashia, Yiğit Doğan, Dhrumil Rajpara, Xingzao Shi, and Luis Casamitjana Ortega under the supervision of Dr. Haqshenas.
 
The files in MRCNNsrc make up all parts of the code a user needs to run the project; these are used in the GUI and included in the package. 

There are also example scripts for those who wish to continue development that show how functions are used with example scripts and data. They also serve as a simplified illustration of parts of the development process. 

The development files directory contains utilities, test scripts, and many other functions that were used during the development process. These are included both to document the work that has been done on the project and in order to provide more detailed and varied examples of the type of development possible.

Alongside the Multires-ML Microscopy app, a supplementary user guide has been created for use, if required.
