Thank you for filling out a Git bug report!
Please answer the following questions to help us understand your issue.

What did you do before the bug happened? (Steps to reproduce your issue)
Within DWT_Denoise if the number of columns of reconstructed approximation coefficients (cA_rec) was equal to 96, then an error is outputed, where the number of columns do not match the number of detail coefficients.

What did you expect to happen? (Expected behavior)
The number of approximation coefficient columns should equal the number of detail coefficient columns.

What happened instead? (Actual behavior)
An extra number of approximation coefficients columns is sometimes generated, meaning the arrays do not match size.

What's different between what you expected and what actually happened?
Different number of approximation and detail coefficient columns. These should be the same. Error only occuring when certain number of decomposition levels are used as an input.
